<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I set up a Jira Service Management environment to simulate a help desk workflow. I implemented a ticketing system that can track and resolve user issues, configure SLAs (Service Level Agreements), automate tasks, and provide customer support through custom workflows. This project allowed me to understand how to use Jira Service Management for managing customer inquiries, handling IT support requests, and maintaining detailed records of support cases to improve response times and team performance..
<br />
<h2> Creating and solving tickets </h2>
After creating the tickets, I worked on resolving them by following predefined workflows and providing troubleshooting steps for the users. For instance, I assisted users with password resets, guided them through network troubleshooting, and helped with basic software installation problems. This step allowed me to familiarize myself with Jira's tools for tracking ticket progress, adding comments, and ensuring that the issues were resolved in a timely manner. <br/>

<h2>Step 2: Set Up SLAs (Service Level Agreements)  </h2>
Next, I configured Service Level Agreements (SLAs) within Jira Service Management to ensure that customer requests were addressed within acceptable timeframes. . <br/>

<h2>Step 3: Set Up Automation for Reopening Tickets: </h2>
To streamline the support process and ensure that all customer inquiries were addressed appropriately, I set up an automation rule in Jira Service Management. The rule automatically reopened a ticket when the customer added a comment to a previously closed request. This ensured that no user feedback was overlooked, and any additional questions or concerns raised by customers would trigger immediate attention.  <br/>
